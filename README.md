# College Notes Website

This project is a React version of a notes website originally built for a college hackathon. The previous version of the site was created using pure HTML and CSS, but this version aims to enhance the site's speed, functionality, and user experience by leveraging React's capabilities.

Motivation: The motivation behind this project stems from the common need for study materials, especially during exam periods. As a fellow backbencher, I understand the struggle of not taking notes during lectures but still requiring them later. In such situations, we often rely on friends to share notes or search for handwritten notes with good legibility. To address this issue, I decided to create a centralized platform where students can access study-related content, including PDF notes.

Features:
- Fast and Responsive: By using React, the website aims to provide a faster and more responsive user experience compared to the previous version.
- Improved Functionality: The site will offer enhanced functionality, such as browsing and searching for notes based on subjects, categories, or keywords.
- Study Resources: Apart from PDF notes, the site will also provide access to other study-related content, including past year question papers and laboratory work materials.
- User-friendly Interface: The React implementation will focus on delivering a user-friendly interface to facilitate seamless browsing and downloading of study materials.

As I continue my coding journey, I plan to expand and improve this project, incorporating additional features and optimizations to make it a comprehensive platform for college students' study needs.
